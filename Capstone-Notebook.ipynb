A rich restauranteur has recognized the vast opportunity in New York City, as the city continues to grow, year over year. He wants to get involved in the New York City restaurant scene and introduce New Yorkers to new cuisines. He has hired me to find which cuisines are the least available in each of the neighborhoods in New York City. Our question will be \"Which cuisine is the least available in each of the neighborhoods of New York City?\" This may seem like a strange question, but the restauranteur is confident that he will be able to gain immense profit from the insight provided by this data analysis. Introducing new food to people is a high risk high reward endeavor and would interest any large scale restauranteur.</p>"
